1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
- No, I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application. Messaging applications have a lot of moving parts, and requires the interaction of many different features of a messaging app (checking the user's input, the server both receiving and sending the message, displaying the sent/received message). A Unit Test would not be able to easily test the "message" feature because it is hard to isolate and relies on so many other functions/applications.
2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
- Yes, a unit test would be appropriate for testing the "max message length". It is easy to isolate, and can be checked and tested individually without impacting other functions of the messaging application.
